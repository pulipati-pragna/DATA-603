# DATA-603 Assignment_1


## BIG DATA WITH EXAMPLE AND TYPES

**_Big Data_** : As the word says, it is the datasets which are bigger in quantities. Due to the data being too large, it is not possible to store, analyze and manipulate data in a short span of time. In the world full of internet users, big data is everywhere. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, etc generate data in millions per second that has to be stored in order to analyse and improve for better usage. This data can be in various forms such as photos, videos, texts, locations and documents. Besides this we can also store financial transaction data from banking applications.

**_Types_** : Types of big data include batches, streamings, graphs, spatio temporal data and many more.


## 6 V'S OF BIG DATA (DEFINE EACH)

**_Volume_** : Volume refers to the amount of data that is retrieve from various sources. Multiple machines are used to store the data.

**_Velocity_** : Velocity refers to the speed at which the data is generated at the sources. In social media applications and sensor applications, the amount of data recorded is very high resulting the data ot have a high velocity.

**_Variety_** : Variety refers to the various forms that the data can be obtained, stored or analysed in. The data can be structured, unstructured or semi structured. And the data elements can be in the form of pictures, text, data, metadata, audio, video, etc.

**_Variability_** : Variability can be defined as the ways in which the data can be made useful or the ways in which it can be formatted.

**_Veracity_** : Veracity measures the quality and accuracy of the data. It can be defined as degree of data that can be trusted. To have high veracity, the data needs to be clear from anamolies, noise and unwanted data.

**_Value_** : Value refers the amount of importance the data brings into the prediction model.


## PHASES OF BIG DATA ANALYSIS (DISUSS EACH)

**_Phase 1 / Data Acquisition and Recovery_** : In this part of analysis, we obtain the real time data into the sources. From data generators such as IoT sensors, social media platforms, sattelite and etc, we can gather the data. Metadata is also one such data generator which consists of the details of the data such as location from which is data is being sent, the time at which it is sent and etc.

**_Phase 2 / Information Extraction and Cleaning / Annotation_** :
